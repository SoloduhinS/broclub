            <h2>Awesomeness is a way of life</h2>
            <p>
              It’s about how you behave and interact in the world. 
              It’s about being your greatest self and putting yourself and what you have to offer out into the world. 
              Being awesome is waking up each morning with the intention of moving forward on your journey, 
              progressing as a person, and wanting to do whatever you can to make a positive difference in your life and the lives of others.

            <h3>SUIT UP</h3>
            <p>
              Have you ever heard the expression you should dress for the job you want, not the one you have?
              Even if you don’t have a career that requires you to suit up each day, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to look nice. 
              It’s as simple as wearing a tailored pant in place of a pair of Levis or choosing a blazer over a zip up sweater.
              It goes for both men and women, when you wear something nice it makes you feel desirable and attractive. 
              If you are the type of guy who enjoys going to the gym, why hide the body you work so hard for under layers of ill-fitting clothing? To summarize: if you got it, flaunt it.
              It could be a boss, a colleague, an ex, or Scarlett Johansson, but if you don’t look a little nicer, 
              it will make you feel like you missed out on making an impression. By wearing nicer clothing or suiting up you eliminate the chances of sending a messy impression. 
              Let’s be honest: you will judge anyone you meet if they’re wearing Crocs and sweatpants.
              Superman has kryptonite. Women . . . well, we have suits. I can tell you with complete and utter confidence, every woman I know (including myself) finds suits irresistible. 
              There is something magnetic about a man wearing a nicely tailored suit. It is almost a weakness, in a good way. There is nothing more attractive than a well-dressed man.
              Although each of the reasons above are important, this single reason is why you should seriously consider dressing better. You should want to look good for yourself. 
              Having confidence in what you are wearing and knowing you are happy in your own skin is a great accomplishment.
              After years of awkward years with bad haircuts and embarrassing wardrobe malfunctions you deserve to look nice.
